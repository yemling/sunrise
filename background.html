    <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>This is a collaborative study between CEH and Indian partners actively engaged with rural and urban communities installing decentralised treatment systems in North and South India (NIH Roorkee, IIT Roorkee, ATREE Bangalore).</p>
		<p>Sustainable supplies of clean water are an essential asset underpinning healthy lives, food production, and opportunities for economic growth.  In rural India, many livelihoods are dependent on water for activities such as crop irrigation, livestock watering and aquaculture. Consequently, water is linked to people's wellbeing as millions of people in rural India rely on it for their food security and to sustain income levels as well as their health and well-being. This makes the management of water resources and waste water treatment a critical issue for sustainable development.  This is a central focus of the Indian Government's Swachh Bharat Mission (<a href="http://www.swachhbharaturban.in/sbm/home/#/SBM"  target="_blank">Clean India Mission</a>) and a target of the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/" target="_blank">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>, particularly <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6" target="_blank">SDG Goal 6</a> on improving sanitation, water quality and protecting water-related ecosystems.</p>
      <p> To help achieve Goal 6, there is a need to develop low-cost, low energy, decentralised waste water treatment systems. Constructed wetlands and ponds are nature-based solutions that can contribute to this challenge. However, the effectiveness of constructed wetlands and ponds schemes to deliver water quality and other benefits, such as food security and health, is not well documented.</p>
      <p>In particular, this study examines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the effectiveness of these treatment systems over changing environmental conditions, particularly dry vs wet (monsoon) seasons?</li>
        <li>What are the opportunities for developing aquaculture or other economic enterprises? Can we measure the economic benefits?</li>
        <li>Are there any health benefits or dis-benefits in relation to human pathogens and vector-borne disease?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given the increasingly complex nature of environmental problems and water management, there is need to develop demonstration studies that will comprehensively explore this issue, and examine the extent to which these systems offer solutions for progressing sustainable development. This is best carried out on an experimental basis which includes case-studies before and after wetland construction, as well as comparison with nearby "control" ponds where no active wetland treatment system is installed i.e. a full Before-After-Control-Intervention (BACI) experimental design.</p>
